Introduction:
Welcome to Twitch Goose, in this app, users are able create a profile to search for their favorite games and streamers.  Additionally, users can see a random list of streamers playing their favorite games and leave reviews for other users to see. Showing random streamers to users, helps new streamers gain exposure to help them grow their following.
